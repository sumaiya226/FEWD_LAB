optimizaton in deep learning refers to the process of adjusting parameters 
(weigths and bias) to minimize a loss func (mse) during training

gradient descent algorithm is an optimization technique used to minimize 
loss func by iteravtiveky adjusting weights and bias by moving in the 
opposite direction of gradient
